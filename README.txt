Multi-Vector Propagation
1 HTTP Flood: Parallel request saturation
2 DNS Tunneling: Hidden payloads in DNS queries
3 P2P Mesh: Direct host-to-host communication

Advanced Evasion
1 Dynamic Code Obfuscation: Real-time code mutation
2 Junk Code Injection: Random padding generation
3 Header Spoofing: Randomized legitimate-looking headers

Network Radar
1 Subnet Scanning: 3 simultaneous subnet probes
2 Po2rt Randomization: Dynamic target port selection
3 WebRTC Exploit: Internal network discovery

Persistence Mechanisms
1 Cross-Platform Autostart: Windows Task Scheduler & cron
2 Process Masquerading: Disguised as "SystemUpdate"
3 Anti-Debugging: Detects inspection tools

Performance Optimization
1 Connection Pooling: Reusable keep-alive sockets
2 Zero Sleep Architecture: No delays between attempts
3 Binary Storage: Faster infection list processing

Self-Preservation
1 1-Hour Decay: Automatic self-destruction
2 Encrypted Payloads: XOR-based code scrambling
3 Process Monitoring: Restarts if terminated



Testing Protocol:
1 Run in isolated VM network
2 Monitor with Wireshark/network tap
3 Use dedicated test machines
4 Never expose to public internet
